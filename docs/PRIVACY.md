# Car Stats Viewer - Privacy Policy

This document explains about personal data that Car Stats Viewer, hereinafter referred to as "the App", collects and why and how it is processed.

## Usage of the App

The Apps primary function is the recording of vehicle data and location. By default this data is only saved locally on the device and is not accessible by the developer. The local data can be deleted permanently by the user at any time.

Furthermore, the App contains multiple API interfaces. Via these APIs data can be transmitted to third parties. These transmissions require an encrypted connection. To which third party services data is transmitted is only controlled by the user. This data may include exact location data. Transmission of location data can be turned off for the entire App or specific APIs. Refer to the privacy policies of the selected third-party services.

## Map view and location

The App uses Mapbox to provide the user with additional geographic information about the data recorded. This means that IP addresses and/or browser identifiers can be transmitted to Mapbox. If the user location is displayed on the map, this data may also be transmitted. Additionally the App might transmit previously recorded location data to provide the user with a visual and readable representation of this data.

Further, Mapbox might collect anonymous usage data to improve their services. This is turned off by default and can be configured in the attributions (i) of Mapbox within the respective map view.

Refer to the [Mapbox privacy policy](https://www.mapbox.com/legal/privacy) for more information.

## Google Firebase Crashlytics and Google Analytics

The App uses Firebase Crashlytics and Analytics, services provided by Google, to collect anonymous crash and error reports as well as general usage data and will transfer them to the developer via internet. This is done so the developer can discover and fix issues in the app.

The user of the app can disable these features via the settings screen. This setting is on by default.

More details about the data usage can be found in [Google's Firebase support documentation](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy).

## Sharing usage & diagnostics data via Google

The Android Automotive system may collect some information regarding the usage of the app and will also send crash reports to the developer via internet. This is a feature implemented by the Android system, not specifically by the app. [Check here to learn more about this feature and how to turn it off](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6078260?hl=en).
